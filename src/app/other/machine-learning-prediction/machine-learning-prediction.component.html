    <!-- Browns Spot Pest Disease Note -->
    <div *ngIf="appUser.ML_generated_pest_prediction == 'Brownspot'">
      <h5><i> Description About the Pest Disease: </i></h5>

      Brown spot is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf
      sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets.Its most observable damage
      is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf.
      When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or
      discolored seeds are formed.

      <br />
      <br /><b>Why it occurs </b> <br />
      The disease can develop in areas with high relative humidity (86−100%) and
      temperature between 16 and 36°C. It is common in unflooded and
      nutrient-deficient soil, or in soils that accumulate toxic substances

      <br /><br /><b>How to identify</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Infected seedlings have small, circular, yellow brown or brown lesions
          that may girdle the coleoptile and distort primary and secondary
          leaves.
        </li>

        <li>
          Starting at tillering stage, lesions can be observed on the leaves.
          They are initially small, circular, and dark brown to purple-brown.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5><i> Recommended Actions: </i></h5>
      Improving soil fertility is the first step in managing brown spot.
      <li>
        Monitor soil nutrients regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply required fertilizers.
      </li>
      <li>
        For soils that are low in silicon, apply calcium silicate slag before
        planting.
      </li>
    </div>

    <!-- Rice Blast Pest Disease Note -->
    <div *ngIf="appUser.ML_generated_pest_prediction == 'Rice Blast'">
      <h5>Symptoms:</h5>

      <br />

      Initial symptoms white to gray-green lesions or spots with darker borders
      produced on all parts of shoot Older lesions elliptical or spindle-shaped
      and whitish to gray with necrotic borders Lesions wide in the center and
      pointed toward either end Lesions may enlarge and coalesce to kill the
      entire leaves Symptoms also observed on leaf collar, culm, culm nodes, and
      the panicle neck node Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the
      infected node Few, no seeds, or whiteheads when neck is infected or
      rotten.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h5>Recommendations</h5>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Application of Carbofuran 3G @ 10-12 kg/acre or spraying of
          Imidaclorprid 200SL @ 40ml or Chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 500ml in 200
          litres of water. Repeat after 7 -10 days if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leaf yellowing can be minimized by spraying 2 % urea mixed with
          Mancozeb at 2.5 gm/lit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of urea foliar fertilizer like multi-K (potassium nitrate) can
          be sprayed at 1 per cent which impart resistance also because of high
          potassium content
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Bacterial Blight -->
    <div *ngIf="appUser.ML_generated_pest_prediction == 'Bacterial blight'">
      <h5>Symptoms:</h5>

      Water-soaked stripes on leaf blades; yellow or white stripes on leaf
      blades; leaves appear grayish in color; plants wilting and rolling up;
      leaves turning yellow; stunted plants; plant death; youngest leaf on plant
      turning yellow

      <br />
      <br />
      <h5>Cause</h5>
      Bacterium

      <br />
      <h5>Comments</h5>
      One of the most important diseases of rice; disease found in tropical and
      temperate regions; greatest economic impact in Asia

      <h5>
        Management
      </h5>
      Bacterial blight can be effectively controlled by planting resistant rice
      varieties; avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization; plow stubble and straw
      into soil after harvest
    </div>

    <!-- False Smut -->
    <div *ngIf="appUser.ML_generated_pest_prediction == 'False smut'">
      <h5>Symptoms</h5>
      Individual rice grain transformed into a mass of velvety spores or yellow
      fruiting bodies Growth of velvety spores enclose floral parts Immature
      spores slightly flattened, smooth, yellow, and covered by a membrane
      Growth of spores result to broken membrane Mature spores orange and turn
      yellowish green or greenish black Only few grains in a panicle are usually
      infected and the rest are normal

      <h5>Recommendations</h5>
      At Boot stage spraying of Copper oxychloride 50% WP @ 2.5 gm/liter. If
      disease persists spray crop with Propiconazole 25% EC @ 1ml/litre of water
      after 15 days interval for effective control of disease.
